> Alex Bratasiuk, director at the iconic Australian winery Clarendon Hills, has been working for his dad, Roman Bratasiuk, CEO, for as long as he can remember. “From pocket money earned as a young kid, to being involved in 10 or so full-time vintages with a winemaker role, to now running the business side of things, I’ve worked in every capacity at the winery across my last 20 years of my life,” Alex says. After a 10-year hiatus in the American market, the Bratasiuks are thrilled to be again importing their premium, single-vineyard Syrah, Grenache, and Cabernet Sauvignon, as well as the flagship Astralis Syrah, back into the U.S. through an exclusive partnership with Vinfolio.
